            <P class="text-justify">The world of Mariachi is traditionally known to be dominated by all male groups. This custom held true until recently. During the past 20 years, there has been an uprising to the concept of an all female mariachi band. Bands such as Mariachi Reyes De Los Angeles and Mariachi Divas have appeared on the professional stage. This is a trend that has mainly made its home in the city of Los Angeles. Though as of now, its ideals have spread down to the south bay with the creation of San Diego’s first all female mariachi: Mariachi Divinas.</P>
	<p class="text-justify">Through the dedication of Director Dulce Perez, Mariachi Divinas was formed out of the local female mariachi population. Since this population is quite small, finding the right people for the job was quite difficult. Dulce then turned to her school friends for help. As a result, the band was created out of experienced female musicians who had been good friends for years.</p>
	<p class="text-justify">Established in 2012, the group is generally still very young. Though they have only been playing as a group for 2 years, their combined musical experience amounts to that of the professionals. San Diego born and raised, Mariachi Divinas sets its sight to contributing to the continuing feminine movement in the world of Mariachi.
